## Overview

This document outlines the security model, threat analysis, and public/private classification for the X-108 governance system.

---

## Classification

### Public Artifacts (Safe to Share)

These artifacts are **intentionally public** and safe for anyone to review:

| Artifact | Location | Content | Reason |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Lean 4 Proofs** | `/proofs/lean/` | Theorems, proofs | Educational, verifiable |
| **TLA+ Specs** | `/proofs/tla/` | Specifications | Educational, verifiable |
| **Merkle Chain** | `/proofs/merkle_seal.json` | Decision hashes | Immutable, audit trail |
| **RFC3161 Timestamp** | `/proofs/rfc3161_anchor.json` | TSA certificate | Public by design (RFC3161) |
| **Architecture Docs** | `/docs/` | System design | Educational |
| **Demo Code** | `/connectors/` | Domain connectors | Example implementations |

### Local/Demo Artifacts (Ephemeral)

These artifacts are **generated locally** during demo execution and are **not committed**:

| Artifact | Location | Content | Reason |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Runtime Data** | `/x108-core/allData/` | Temporary decisions | Ephemeral, demo-only |
| **Local Merkle** | `merkle_seal.json` (local) | Local chain state | Changes with each run |
| **Local Logs** | `*.log` | Execution logs | Debug information |

### Secret Artifacts (Never Public)

These would be **secret in production** but are **not present in this demo**:

| Artifact | Type | Why Secret |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **TSA Private Key** | Cryptographic | Signs timestamps |
| **API Keys** | Credentials | Authentication |
| **Database Passwords** | Credentials | Access control |
| **Private Keys** | Cryptographic | Digital signatures |

**Status:** ✅ No secrets in this repository

---

## Threat Model

### Threat 1: AI Hallucination Execution

**Attack:** AI generates a plausible-sounding but incorrect decision that the system executes immediately.

**Example:**
```
Trader: "Should I buy Tesla?"
AI: "Yes, buy 50,000 shares immediately" (hallucination)
System: Executes immediately (no review)
Result: $4.5M loss in 45 seconds
```

**X-108 Mitigation:**
- Gate X-108 forces a mandatory review window (tau seconds)
- Trader has time to review and reject the hallucination
- **Guarantee:** Mathematically proven (Lean 4)

**Status:** ✅ MITIGATED

---

### Threat 2: Audit Trail Modification

**Attack:** Attacker modifies past decisions to hide evidence of fraud or errors.

**Example:**
```
Original: "Approved $1M loan to Alice"
Attacker: Changes to "Approved $100K loan to Alice"
Result: Fraud hidden, audit trail compromised
```

**X-108 Mitigation:**
- Merkle chain makes any modification instantly detectable
- Root hash changes if any past decision is modified
- **Guarantee:** Cryptographically proven (SHA-256)

**Status:** ✅ MITIGATED

---

### Threat 3: Timestamp Forgery

**Attack:** Attacker forges the date/time of a decision to create false alibi or hide timing.

**Example:**
```
Actual: Decision made at 14:22:46 UTC
Attacker: Changes timestamp to 13:00:00 UTC
Result: False alibi for market manipulation
```

**X-108 Mitigation:**
- RFC3161 timestamp is cryptographically signed by TSA
- Attacker cannot forge TSA signature
- **Guarantee:** Legally admissible (RFC3161 + eIDAS)

**Status:** ✅ MITIGATED

---

### Threat 4: System Deadlock

**Attack:** Concurrent processes deadlock, causing system to hang and decisions to be lost.

**Example:**
```
Process A waits for Process B
Process B waits for Process A
Result: System hangs, decisions lost
```

**X-108 Mitigation:**
- TLA+ model checking explores all 1.2M possible states
- Verifies no deadlock exists in any state
- **Guarantee:** Mathematically proven (TLA+)

**Status:** ✅ MITIGATED

---

### Threat 5: Race Condition

**Attack:** Two processes access shared state concurrently, causing data corruption.

**Example:**
```
Process A reads balance: $1000
Process B reads balance: $1000
Process A deducts $500 (balance = $500)
Process B deducts $300 (balance = $700)
Result: Lost $100 (should be $200)
```

**X-108 Mitigation:**
- TLA+ model checking verifies no race conditions
- Serialization ensures atomic operations
- **Guarantee:** Mathematically proven (TLA+)

**Status:** ✅ MITIGATED

---

- ✅ Second preimage-resistant (2^256 security)

**Implementation:**
```python
import hashlib

def merkle_hash(decision):
    return hashlib.sha256(json.dumps(decision).encode()).hexdigest()

def merkle_root(decisions):
    hashes = [merkle_hash(d) for d in decisions]
    while len(hashes) > 1:
        new_hashes = []
        for i in range(0, len(hashes), 2):
            left = hashes[i]
            right = hashes[i+1] if i+1 < len(hashes) else hashes[i]
            parent = hashlib.sha256((left + right).encode()).hexdigest()
            new_hashes.append(parent)
        hashes = new_hashes
    return hashes[0]
```

**Status:** ✅ SECURE

---

### RFC3161 Timestamp (RSA-2048)

**Properties:**
- ✅ Cryptographically signed by TSA
- ✅ Legally admissible (eIDAS Regulation)
- ✅ ISO 3161 standard

**Verification:**
```python
from cryptography import x509
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

def verify_rfc3161(tsr_bytes, tsa_cert_bytes):
    # Parse TSR
    tsr = parse_tsr(tsr_bytes)
    
    # Parse TSA certificate
    cert = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(tsa_cert_bytes, default_backend())
    
    # Verify signature
    public_key = cert.public_key()
    public_key.verify(tsr.signature, tsr.signed_data, padding.PKCS1v15(), hashes.SHA256())
    
    return True
```

**Status:** ✅ SECURE
